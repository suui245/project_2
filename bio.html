            Darius Yeung is a visual artist based in both Montreal and Hong
            Kong. Through semi-abstract and surrealistic drawings as well as
            paintings, he explores various themes, and most prominently include
            self-identity and the displacement of foreign bodies. He uses art as
            a record of his personal life, expressing his innermost feelings.
            Having been practicing art for more than 15 years, he has developed
            a strong sense of visual arts and mature techniques in various
            mediums, such as oil, acrylics and ink pen. Born and raised in Hong
            Kong, he grew up receiving both Eastern and Western influence, which
            can be distinguished from the topics addressed in his works. He
            graduated from Jockey Club Ti-I College in Hong Kong and is
            currently completing his undergraduate degree in Studio Arts and Art
            History at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. He has been
            awarded the full scholarship- "Wharf Art Scholarships" from Wharf
            Real Estate Company in Hong Kong. His works have been showcased in
            local art magazines and exhibitions in Canada, Hong Kong and the
            United Kingdom.
